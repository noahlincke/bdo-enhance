# BDO Enhancement Calculator
#### PLEASE NOTE! THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL PROFIT CALCULATOR, RELEASING THE FULL TOOL PUBLICLY WOULD CRASH THE IN-GAME MARKET.
* v1.0 is currently complete but available privately only.
* The two notebooks shown are simply results of my first hour exploring the probabilistic data.

### Visualize and explore statistics related to enhancing in the game Black Desert Online
### Private Calculator Features:
* View expected profit of any item at any attempted enhancement level!
* Prices of materials and items always up to date (through market API)

If you are a recruiter looking at my Github:
Contact me and I will be in touch with the source code shortly.

If you are interested in using the tool yourself:
Send me an email at noah@lincke.org and we can arrange a private purchase (price is very reasonable and subject to negotiation).

# TODO 
 * [x] Update graphics on the spot from pricing scraped through bdo-marketplace API
 * [ ] Add custom risk aversion curve for even more fine-tuned optimization on a personal level
